                            "Helen did my flowers for my wedding. From the table centerpiece flower arrangments, the flowers for the bridesmaids, my bouquet, my mother in law's corsage, button holes and my thankyou flowers, Helen was nothing but professional, helpful and courteous.
                            Her prices were reasonable and the Tables looked stunning on the day.
                            Thankyou Helen.
                            You were brilliant"

She listended to what I wanted and suggested flowers that would work well with my colour scheme. The advice received throughout the whole process was invaluable. The end product from my bouquet to the button holes were flawless."
