                            started my journey in floristry by stepping in at the last minute to help out at a relatives wedding.
                            I was asked to try and make the church look a little more 'cheerful' by putting together some floral arrangements, Challenge Accepted! I soon realised how much I was enjoying it.
                        </p>

                        <p>A few weddings funerals and birthdays later, I found myself training in the art of floristry at a local college. I have since then attended workshops to keep up with the current trends, and enhance my knowledge.</p>

                        <p>A passion for beautiful fresh flowers and wonderful materials keep me driven to produce exciting floral designs.</p>

                        <p>Weddings are my main focus and I love working with couples creating designs that bring pleasure, joy and meaning to their 'Big Day', using vintage, romantic and whimsy designs, to contempory, modern and sleek arrangements.</p>
